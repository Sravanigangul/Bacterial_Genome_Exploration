# Bacterial_Genome_Exploration

Data Collection :The AMR and genomic data were sourced from the BV-BRC (Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center) website, which provides comprehensive resources for bacterial and viral genomics. Genomes associated with E. coli and cefepime resistance were specifically scraped and downloaded to gather relevant sequence data. Additionally, CARD (Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database) data pertaining to antimicrobial resistance mechanisms was retrieved to complement the genomic information. This combined data forms the basis for downstream analysis, including sequence alignment and machine learning modeling.

Data preparation: Involved using Bowtie 2 to search for CARD resistance sequences within the E. coli genomes. Bowtie index files were utilized for efficient sequence searching, producing SAM files that contain alignment data. These SAM files were then processed to extract sequence information for gene matches, which was organized into a DataFrame for further analysis. The resulting dataset provides structured insights into resistance-associated gene alignments for downstream exploration.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) focused on understanding nucleotide frequencies in gene sequences to uncover patterns and potential mutations. By visualizing random gene samples, differences in nucleotide prevalence were observed, providing insights into functionality and mutation trends. The analysis also reviewed raw data, identified usable columns, examined target distributions, and flagged questionable E. coli genomes. These steps laid the groundwork for understanding relationships between samples and genes, preparing for deeper analyses in subsequent assignments.

Data visualization focused on understanding the distribution of resistance genes and their relationship with susceptibility (S) or resistance (R) targets. A bar plot was created to illustrate the count of each resistance gene (res_gene) on the x-axis, with target categories (S/R) differentiated by color. This approach helps identify patterns and trends in gene presence and their associated resistance levels, aiding feature selection and model design.

Feature baseline modeling involves counting k-mers (subsequences of length K) present in genomic sequences, creating a feature matrix where rows represent genomes and columns represent all possible k-mers. For the first five genomes, 16,245 unique 7-mers were observed, but a complete feature matrix requires accounting for all 16,384 possible k-mers to ensure consistency with future data. This approach is straightforward but may be computationally intensive for larger k-mers due to the exponential increase in features. Advanced strategies, such as incorporating all genes or optimizing sequence representation, may improve predictive accuracy and resource efficiency.

Model optimization and interpretation reveal the performance of various classification models. Logistic Regression, used as the baseline, achieved an accuracy of 91%, showcasing its effectiveness for the dataset. Na√Øve Bayes emerged as the best-performing model with an accuracy of 93%, indicating its suitability for the data's probabilistic structure. In contrast, the Decision Tree model had a lower accuracy of 84%, suggesting it may have overfitted or struggled with feature complexity.

Naive Bayes performed well in this case due to its assumption of feature independence, which is appropriate for genomic data where each gene's presence or absence may independently contribute to resistance. The model's simplicity and efficiency in handling large feature spaces, like the numerous k-mers in the dataset, make it suitable for this type of high-dimensional data. Furthermore, Naive Bayes excels in scenarios with categorical data, such as the binary classification of resistant vs. non-resistant genes. Its high accuracy and F1 score indicate its effectiveness in distinguishing between these classes.

Insights:

This project aids healthcare by enabling early detection of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) through genomic analysis, allowing for more effective treatment decisions. It supports personalized medicine by identifying resistant genes in pathogens, leading to tailored therapies and reducing unnecessary antibiotic use. Additionally, the project contributes to public health efforts by providing data for monitoring AMR trends and guiding policy and resource allocation to combat resistance.
